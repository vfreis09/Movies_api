A rest api with express, sequelize and postgres.

My goal with this project was to fix some fundamentals with rest api in general and with sequelize too. I did other project before without including an update and delete function on the rest api, so this one i did it as well.

I learned about the mvc pattern while i was doing this project so i implemented it too.

Frameworks that im using in this project: node, express, postman, postgres, sequelize, body-parser, nodemon, pg, pg-hstore.
